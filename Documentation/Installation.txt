Instructions for using Grant Manager 2.0 with SQL Server Express:

1. Install SQL Server 2008 Express (and Management Studio) from here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22973
Versions newer than 2008 will probably work as well.
You can follow the directions on this page - http://wiki.octopusnetwork.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=26837026 - except your password doesn't have to be "octopus" and you don't have to go onto the next page.

2. Once you have SQL Server Management Studio open and connected, create a new database called "grantapp".

3. Run the SQL scripts in Management Studio, in alphabetical order. (Alternatively, you can run the file "Scripts 1-16 combined.sql".)
The script 16-create db user.sql creates a database user/password. By default, the username is "grantuser" and the password is "pw,1,LVCV". You can change these if you like.

4. Run the script "version 2.0.sql" in the updates folder. This will update the database from a v1.0 schema to a v2.0 schema (by adding tables for attachments, timeline dates, and budget items, and dropping some unused columns.)

5. On each computer, copy GrantApp.exe, GrantApp.exe.config, KellermanSoftware.Compare-NET-Objects.dll and MonthCalendar.dll to a folder. (You can find them in GrantApp/bin/Release.)

6. GrantApp.exe.config is a text file. Since you're not using Database2.mdf, change it to look something like this:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
	<configuration>
	  <connectionStrings>
		<add name="GrantApp.Properties.Settings.Database1ConnectionString"
		  connectionString="Data Source=192.168.1.17;Initial Catalog=grantapp;Persist Security Info=True;User Id=grantuser;Password=asdfghjkl"
		  providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	  </connectionStrings>
	</configuration>
The important part is the connectionString="..." line. Use the "User Id" and "Password" you made by running 16-create db user.sql, and set "Data Source" to the IP address of the SQL server.
