1. Run the script "version 2.0.sql" in the updates folder. This will update the database from a v1.0 schema to a v2.0 schema (by adding tables for attachments, timeline dates, and budget items, and dropping some unused columns.)

2. On each computer, replace the existing GrantApp.exe, GrantApp.pdb and MonthCalendar.dll with the new versions. (You can find them in GrantApp/bin/Release.)
Database2.mdf and Database2_log.ldf are not needed - they contain an empty database stored locally, and you have a database on your server.
Keep the existing GrantApp.exe.config if any; otherwise, follow steps 5 and 6 in Instructions.txt instead of this step.
