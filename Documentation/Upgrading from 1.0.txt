1. Run the script "version 2.0.sql" in the updates folder. This will update the database from a v1.0 schema to a v2.0 schema (by adding tables for attachments, timeline dates, and budget items, and dropping some unused columns.)

2. On each computer, replace the existing GrantApp.exe and MonthCalendar.dll with the new versions. Also copy over KellermanSoftware.Compare-NET-Objects.dll. (You can find them in GrantApp/bin/Release.)
Keep the existing GrantApp.exe.config if any. (Otherwise, follow steps 5 and 6 in Instructions.txt instead of this step.)
