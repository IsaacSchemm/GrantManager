Instructions for using Grant Manager with SQL Server Express:

1. Install SQL Server 2008 Express (and Management Studio) from here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22973
Versions newer than 2008 will probably work as well.
You can follow the directions on this page - http://wiki.octopusnetwork.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=26837026 - except your password doesn't have to be "octopus" and you don't have to go onto the next page.

2. Once you have SQL Server Management Studio open and connected, create a new database called "grantapp".

3. Run the SQL scripts in Management Studio, in alphabetical order. (Alternatively, you can run the file "Scripts 1-16 combined.sql".)
The script 16-create db user.sql creates a database user/password. By default, the username is "grantuser" and the password is "pw,1,LVCV". You can change these if you like.

4a. On each computer, copy GrantApp.exe, GrantApp.exe.config, GrantApp.pdb and MonthCalendar.dll to a folder. (You can find them in GrantApp/bin/Release.)
Database2.mdf and Database2_log.ldf are not needed - they contain an empty database stored locally, and you have a database on your server.

4b. GrantApp.exe.config is a text file. Since you're not using Database2.mdf, change it to look something like this:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
	<configuration>
	  <connectionStrings>
		<add name="GrantApp.Properties.Settings.Database1ConnectionString"
		  connectionString="Data Source=192.168.1.17;Initial Catalog=grantapp;Persist Security Info=True;User Id=grantuser;Password=asdfghjkl"
		  providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	  </connectionStrings>
	</configuration>
The important part is the connectionString="..." line. Use the "User Id" and "Password" you made by running 16-create db user.sql, and set "Data Source" to the IP address of the SQL server.
